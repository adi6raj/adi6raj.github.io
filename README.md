Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a space on the grid with their symbol, either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid fills up without a winner, the game is a draw.
